The p-value = 5.35e-11, which is basically zero. The R-squared value is 0.7149 which means that about 71% of our data points are in the model. From this we could conclude that our model fairly able to predict MPG based upon the other variables but I wouldn't completly trust it


## Deliverable 2: Create Visualizations for the Trip Analysis

Below you can se the summary statistics for the suspension coils:

As seen in the image above the variance comply with the requirements estabilished in the specifications

Wer can pbserve that Lot number 3 has a variance that exceeds the 100 limit, given this, it should be throughly checked and corrected before it continues to operate.
